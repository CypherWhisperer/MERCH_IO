/* Sass Aggregator Partial: This file brings the partials in this current directory together 
   * Unlike CSS variables, Sass mixins and placeholders (%) are not global.
   * They only exist in the file they are defined in unless explicitly imported 
     (or @used) in the same Sass compilation scope.
     
   * My Global index.css (imported in main.jsx) does see the mixins/utilities 
   * but individual SCSS module files (i.e, for components and pages) do not.
   * So when Vite compiles those isolated .module.scss files, 
   * it has no knowledge of the contents of the files (i.e the mixins, utility classes, e.t.c)

   * When you use @import, Sass merges namespaces globally (kind of like dumping everything in one scope),
   * but with Vite and PostCSS pipelines (especially alongside Tailwind), it can be unreliable — particularly
   * because Tailwind runs after Sass processing.
   * So sometimes those @import statements are processed in unexpected order, leading to missing mixin or not 
   * applied utility issues.

   * Another issue is that Sass plans to eventually remove @import, so Option A is future-proof.

   * vite config can also be updated to auto-import the global setup (optional, but powerful)
        export default defineConfig({

            preprocessorOptions: {
              scss: {
                additionalData: `@use "@/assets/styles/index" as *;`
              }
            } 
          }
        })

   * This file comes to the rescue by bringing them together - simply `@use` it at every scss file:
      `@use "@/assets/styles/index" as *;`
   * So index.css exposses them ina global manner, and _index.scss exposes them to the page/component's scss  
*/

/* Sass’s new @use requires explicit extensions and doesn’t automatically resolve 
 * underscores or missing extensions in all contexts (depends on implementation). This ensures consistency.

/*  Loading Sass Partials First: the @use statements must come first.

 * I turned to the sasss option of modules:

 * The '_' tells the sass compiler that the file is a partial and hence
